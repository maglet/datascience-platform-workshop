# ### Loading libraries
# 
# To use the functions in `seaborn` and `pandas`, run the following code to load these libraries with aliases `sns` and `pd`. 

# In[5]:


import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd


# ## The Data
# 
# The data set that weâ€™ll be working with contains data about various characteristics of small animals from an ecological study.
# * each row is an inidvidual animal trapped by field scientists
# * each column has data about the trapped animals  like species, sex and weight. 

# ### Loading the data
# 
# Use the `pandas` function `read_csv` to load the data. 

# In[8]:


surveys = pd.read_csv('data/complete_surveys.csv')


# ### Scatterplot
# 
# To make a scatterplot, use `replot` and specify what dataset you're using (like with `distplot`) and what variables you want to plot on the `x` and `y` axes.

# In[46]:


sns.relplot(data=surveys,
            x="weight", 
            y="hindfoot_length", 
            alpha = 0.1, 
            hue = "species_id")

print("I made a plot!")
